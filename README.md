AICO (AI‑CO) is a bare‑metal, multi‑model AI operating system that runs directly on the hardware, isolates every inference engine behind strict safety‑audit layers, and allows only a central controller to issue any external effect. It embeds continuous introspection, bias detection, narrative coherence, thermal‑aware scheduling, and hardware‑level kill‑switches, making it a self‑regulating, provably‑safe platform for general‑purpose AI—designed to be open‑source (MIT) and to prevent the emergence of unsafe, unaligned bare‑metal AI systems.
